### 🌍 Introduction to Terraform

**Terraform** is an **open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool** developed by **HashiCorp**. It allows you to **define, provision, and manage infrastructure** such as servers, networks, databases, and cloud services using **simple configuration files** instead of manual setup.

With Terraform, infrastructure is written as **code** (using a language called **HCL – HashiCorp Configuration Language**), which makes it **version-controlled, reusable, and automated**.

### 🚀 Why Terraform is Used

* To **automate infrastructure provisioning**
* To manage **cloud and on-prem resources**
* To ensure **consistency and repeatability**
* To reduce **manual errors**
* To support **DevOps & CI/CD pipelines**

---

### ☁️ Supported Platforms

Terraform works with multiple providers, including:

* AWS
* Azure
* Google Cloud (GCP)
* Kubernetes
* Docker
* On-prem infrastructure

👉 This makes Terraform **cloud-agnostic**.

---

### 🔑 Key Concepts

* **Provider** – Defines the cloud or platform (AWS, Azure, etc.)
* **Resource** – Infrastructure components (EC2, VPC, VM, etc.)
* **State file** – Keeps track of the real infrastructure
* **Plan** – Shows what Terraform will create/change
* **Apply** – Executes the changes

---

### ⭐ Benefits of Terraform

* Infrastructure as code
* Multi-cloud support
* Easy to scale
* Declarative approach (you say *what* you want, not *how*)
* Strong community support

---

### 🧠 In Simple Words

> Terraform helps you **build, change, and manage infrastructure safely and efficiently using code**.
